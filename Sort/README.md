# Sort

## 2.Selection sort

The selection sort algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a given array

1) The subarray which is already sorted
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted

Time complexity => best : Θ(n), worst : Θ(n<sup>2</sup>)
