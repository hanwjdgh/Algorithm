# Greedy Algorithm

An algorithmic paradigm that follows the problem solving approach of making the locaaly optimal choice at each stage with the hope of inding a global optimum. </br>
- Pros : simple, easy to implement, run fast
- Cons : very often they don't provide a globally optimum solution (ex, 0-1 Knapsack)

## When to use?
1. Greedy - choice property : A global optimum can be arrived at by selecting a loval optimum.
2. optimal Substructure : An optimal solution to the problem contaions an optimal solutioin to subproblems.

## Greedy algorithm example
1. Kruskal’s Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
2. Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree
3. Dijkstra’s Shortest Path
4. Huffman Coding
